About IFCAT
================

The Stichting International Festivals for Creative Application of Technology Foundation (IFCAT) facilitates 
the organizing of the quadrennial Dutch hacker camps. Currently this is [SHA2017](https://sha2017.org "SHA2017").


Why? Hackers improve the world through technology. We believe that hacker camps help strengthening the community: it's
a good time, gives energy, fostering new ideas and projects.


IFCAT supports the organization of the dutch hacker camps in the following ways:
* Bringing together and supporting volunteers
* Entering into legal agreements
* Management and accountability of finances (such as budgeting)
* Keeping overview of progress and health of the event and people associated

IFCAT History
=============
The IFCAT foundation was founded in 2011 as a legal vehicle for OHM2013.

After the OHM2013 event the role of IFCAT changed to search for a new group to organize the 2017 event.

In 2016 a new group of organizers formally took on the role of leading the 2017 event and managing the IFCAT foundation.
